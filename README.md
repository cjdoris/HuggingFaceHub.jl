# ðŸ¤— HuggingFaceHub.jl

A Julia package to interact with the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/).

- Search for repos (models, datasets and spaces).
- Get repo metadata.
- Download and upload files.
- Supports private repos.
- Call the Inference API to easily make model predictions.

## Install

```
pkg> add https://github.com/cjdoris/HuggingFaceHub.jl
```

## API

None of these functions are exported. You can import the module like
`import HuggingFaceHub as HF` to access the functions like `HF.models()`.

Read the docstrings for more information about each function.

### Repositories

- `models()` (search for models)
- `datasets()` (search for datasets)
- `spaces()` (search for spaces)
- `model(id)` (get info about a model)
- `dataset(id)` (get info about a dataset)
- `space(id)` (get info about a space)
- `refresh(repo)` (return updated info for a repo)
- `model_create(id)` (create a new model)
- `dataset_create(id)` (create a new dataset)
- `space_create(id)` (create a new space)
- `delete(repo)` (delete a repo)
- `update(repo)` (update metadata on a repo)
- `move(repo, dest)` (move a repo)
- `file_upload(repo, path, file)` (upload a file to a repo)
- `file_delete(repo, path)` (delete a file from a repo)
- `file_open(f, repo, path)` (open a file from a repo)
- `file_read(repo, path, [T])` (read a file from a repo)

### Metadata

- `model_tags()` (dict of groups of model tags)
- `dataset_tags()` (dict of groups of dataset tags)
- `metrics()` (list of metrics)

### Users / Tokens

Some operations, such as modifying a repo or accessing a private repo, require you to
authenticate yourself using a token.

You can generate a token at [Hugging Face settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens),
then copy it, call `token_prompt()` and paste the token. The token will be saved to disk so
you only need to do this once.

Alternatively you can set the token in the environment variable `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN`.

- `whoami()` (get info about the current user)
- `token()` (get the current token)
- `token_set(token)` (set the token)
- `token_prompt()` (set the token from a prompt)
- `token_file()` (the file where the token is saved)

### Clients

A client controls things like the URL of the Hugging Face REST API and the token to
authenticate with.

There is a global default client, which is suitable for most users. But you may also create
new clients and pass them as the `client` keyword argument to most other functions.

- `client()` (get the default client)
- `Client()` (construct a new client)

### Inference API

Refer to [the Inference API documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/detailed_parameters)
for details about inputs and parameters.

- `infer(model, inputs)` (call the Inference API, return the inference results)
